OOCSS Compass implementation
============================

The implementation of OOCSS into Compass using SASS.

I will add the ability to use namespaces, of your choice, or not. i.e. om- for mod related definitions.


TO DO
=====

1. Grab colors and sizes off the framework and define them into the main variable file (definitions.scss).
2. Implements namespaces variables into the framework.
3. Add the project definition
4. Add the examples
5. Document!


Installation
============

I will create a gem when the Framework will be stable enough. For now, copy the folder stylesheet and template into a new folder created at the root of compass frameworks


Usage
=====

Build the gem
-------------

Open the command line into your working copy and type

`gem build oocss-compass.gemspec`

Install the gem
---------------

In the folder where the gem resides, with the command line, type:

`sudo gem install oocss-compass-[GEMVERSION].gem`


Create a project
----------------

Open the command line in the folder you want to create your project and type:

`compass create [PROJECTNAME] -r oocss-compass --using oocss-compass`
